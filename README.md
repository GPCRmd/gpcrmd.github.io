**Instructions.** Just edit the  **index.md**  webpage.  

Other editable parts (at risk of breaking things) are

* _layouts/page.html
* css/main.css
* images/cover.jpg  (appears at the top)
* images/logo.jpg   (appears on the left)

After each commit, the website is regenerated and publised at http://gpcrmd.github.io/ (after ~ 5 seconds).



Based  on the "flex"  template: see README_flex.md .
